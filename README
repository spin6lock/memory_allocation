From the `man 3 free` page, FreeBSD seems to use bitmap to keep information about 
avaliable memory. Linux, on the other hand, uses linked-list instead and insists this is the C89 and C99 standard.

The difference of memory allocation have different behaviours on mistaken using of free(3). On FreeBSD, after malloc to ptr, and ptr++, free(3) can still work properly.[*DON'T RELY ON THIS*] This demo tests extremely condition: allocate 1MB memory and only free the second half part of it. Then it leads to almost 4GB VIRT occupied and I don't know why.
